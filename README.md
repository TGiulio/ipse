# ipse
ipse is a very simple version of the Dixit game that I made during the lockdown to play with my friends.

It is my first "full-stack" application, even if it's really simple, and it was the first time I used a database.

The Dixit game is not my creation and I don't own any copyright of the game or the cards shown below. Dixit is an [Asmodee](https://www.asmodee.com) board game.

Here's some details:

## Waiting for inspiration
In the first part of the game the narrator must choose a card to play and an inspiration to guide the other players to his card.

## One card to trick them all

Once everyone has the inspiration all players must individually choose a card of their own to deceive the others in the final stage.

## Choose wisely

The last part of the match is about guessing which card was choosen by the narrator, you gain points if you guess correctly and if someone vote your card instead of the right one
